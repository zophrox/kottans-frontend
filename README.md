- This course helped me to reestablish basic knowledge in HTML and CSS.
- Although the course in htmlacademy was not new to me, it was interesting to rebuild my knowledge.
- Yet, after completing this course, I would recommend Kottans to suggest that students first pass the "HTML Academy", and then offer students a course on Udacity.
