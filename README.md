- This course helped me to reestablish basic knowledge in HTML and CSS.
- Although the course in htmlacademy was not new to me, it was interesting to rebuild my knowledge.
- Yet, after completing this course, I would recommend Kottans to suggest that students first pass the "HTML Academy", and then offer students a course on Udacity.

using breakpoints and mediaqueries, tochange the page layout for different devices.
- At this point, i've got all the tools and concepts you need to build amazing responsive sites.

 - Thanks to this course, I became acquainted with the basics of JS. Theoretically (and partially practically) I know what is a variable, loops (while and for), a function, an array, and an object.
 - More practical to master knowledge, mainly on using the array and its properties and methods, helped the freecodecamp.
 - In general, in my opinion, these basic knowledge is sufficient for continuing education in the field of JS.

### DOM

 - I learned about the most important and complex JavaScript language features, including areas, closures, keyword this and prototype chains.
 - I also learned a lot of different code reuse patterns that are built on top of those features, such as function decorators and all of the major classing and subclassing patterns that are available within JavaScript.
